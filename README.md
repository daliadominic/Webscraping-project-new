# Webscraping-project-new

The project contains 2 part 
1.Webscraping 
2.ML 
Steps:

    1.collected a dataset contains 2738 urls and saved in the "DATASET2738_before_webscraping.csv" file
    2. Run the 'Webscraping_part.ipynb' file for extracting the content from the urls.(it will take minimum 2 hours)
    Result:A new csv file created "Dataset_2738_after_webscraping.csv" 
    3.Run the "Machine_Learning_traintest.ipynb" file for doing the ML part(This is the main code for checking the accuracy and performance of all the classifiers)
    4.Run the "Machine_Learning_prediction.ipynb" file for checking the prediction of 75 data

6 classifiers are used

1.Decision tree 2.Naive Bayes 3.SVM 4.KNN 5.SGD 6.Random Forest

Note: dataset75iotnoniot.csv,dataset75iot.csv,dataset75noniot.csv files are used fore checking the prediction
